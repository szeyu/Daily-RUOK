## Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 (SDG 3.4) 
By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being

## Overview
The imperative achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) - Good Health and Well-being is essential for fostering global emotional well-being. Prioritizing quality healthcare and overall well-being not only impacts physical health but also nurtures positive emotional states. Addressing mental health challenges and supporting emotional resilience establishes a foundation for societies to experience a higher quality of life. 
The "Daily RUOK" system, with its focus on daily check-ins and positive reflections, aligns seamlessly with SDG 3 by promoting emotional self-awareness and resilience. This holistic approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of mental and physical health, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive strategies to address emotional wellness in building a healthier and more sustainable global community.

## Specifications
### Personalised Emotional Support
"Daily RUOK" provides users with personalised responses, including advice, compliments, and motivational messages, tailored to their daily input.

### Comprehensive Emotional Data Recording
The system records and organizes user input over time, creating a comprehensive emotional well-being profile for each individual.

### Visualised Emotional Journey
Through intuitive graphical representations, such as graphs, the system visually illustrates the user's emotional journey. This allows users to track patterns, recognise trends, and observe their emotional progress over time.

### Positive Reflection Encouragement
Focusing on daily check-ins and encouraging positive reflections, the system actively promotes emotional self-awareness and resilience.

### Compassionate Companion
Acting as a compassionate companion, the "Daily RUOK" system guides individuals toward sustained emotional well-being and personal growth.

## Google Technology Used
## PaLM API (Maker Suite)
Google products that can be used to prototype and build generative AI applications.

## Specific Issues Faced:
### Interpreting Emotional Tone: 
Developing an algorithm that accurately discerns the emotional context from text inputs.

### Generating Appropriate Responses: 
Creating a response mechanism that is both relevant to the user's emotional state and offers constructive support or advice.

### Scalability: 
Ensuring the solution can handle a large number of users simultaneously without degradation in performance.

## Addressing the Challenge:
### Algorithm Development:
Approach: Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user input.
Tools Used: Implementation of sentiment analysis using libraries like Palm API for deeper contextual understanding.
Technical Decision: Opting for a machine learning-based approach to ensure adaptability and accuracy in emotional tone interpretation.

### Response Generation:
Approach: Crafting a response generator that uses emotional analysis to create personalized messages.
Technical Decision: Integrating pre-defined response templates with dynamic content generation, ensuring responses are empathetic and varied.

### User Interface Integration:
Approach: Seamlessly integrating the backend emotional analysis and response system with the user interface.
Technical Decision: Choosing a responsive and intuitive frontend framework (Streamlit) that communicates effectively with the backend.
