## Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 (SDG 3.4) 
*By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.*

## Overview
Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) - Good Health and Well-being is crucial for fostering global emotional well-being. Prioritizing quality healthcare not only impacts physical health but also nurtures positive emotional states. The "Daily RUOK" system aligns seamlessly with SDG 3 by promoting emotional self-awareness and resilience.

## Specifications
1. **Personalised Emotional Support**
   - Daily RUOK provides users with personalized responses, including advice, compliments, and motivational messages tailored to their daily input.

2. **Comprehensive Emotional Data Recording**
   - The system records and organizes user input over time, creating a comprehensive emotional well-being profile for each individual.

3. **Visualised Emotional Journey**
   - Intuitive graphical representations visually illustrate the user's emotional journey, allowing users to track patterns and observe progress over time.

4. **Positive Reflection Encouragement**
   - Focusing on daily check-ins and encouraging positive reflections, the system actively promotes emotional self-awareness and resilience.

5. **Compassionate Companion**
   - Acting as a compassionate companion, the "Daily RUOK" system guides individuals toward sustained emotional well-being and personal growth.

## Google Technology Used
- **PaLM API (Maker Suite)**
  - Google products used to prototype and build generative AI applications.

## Specific Issues Faced:
1. **Interpreting Emotional Tone**
   - Developing an algorithm that accurately discerns the emotional context from text inputs.

2. **Generating Appropriate Responses**
   - Creating a response mechanism that is relevant to the user's emotional state and offers constructive support or advice.

3. **Scalability**
   - Ensuring the solution can handle a large number of users simultaneously without degradation in performance.

## Addressing the Challenge:
1. **Algorithm Development**
   - Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user input.
   - Implementation of sentiment analysis using libraries like Palm API for deeper contextual understanding.

2. **Response Generation**
   - Crafting a response generator that uses emotional analysis to create personalized messages.
   - Integrating pre-defined response templates with dynamic content generation.

3. **User Interface Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrating the backend emotional analysis and response system with the user interface.
   - Choosing a responsive and intuitive frontend framework (Streamlit) that communicates effectively with the backend.
